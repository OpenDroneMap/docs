msgid "ODM, NodeODM and WebODM are available on all major platforms (Windows, macOS and Linux) via a program called docker, which is required to run the software. Docker offers a way to run “containers”. Containers are packaged copies of an entire system, its software and its dependencies. These containers run within a virtual environment. On Linux this virtual environment is available from the operating system and is very efficient. On macOS and Windows the containers run within a VM, so there’s a bit of a overhead. but it’s still very suitable for running the software. Once installed users do not have to worry much about docker, as it operates (almost) transparently."

However, because there’s very little performance penalty for running docker on Linux and docker is straightforward to setup on this platform, we don’t recommend it. On Linux the advantages of containerization far outweigh a tiny performance penalty. With docker users also get easy one-step updates of the software, so that’s nice."
