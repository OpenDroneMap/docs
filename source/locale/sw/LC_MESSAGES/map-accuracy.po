"Accuracy can be defined as the degree or closeness to which the information "
"on a map matches the values in the real world. Therefore, when we refer to "
"accuracy, we are talking about quality of data and about number of errors "
"contained in a certain dataset (Pascual 2011)."

"Each project has specific accuracy needs to be met. For instance assessing "
"the progress in a construction site or measuring an area affected by a fire "
"does not require the use of GCP, since absolute accuracy will not impact the"

"accuracy is critical, for example project compliance evaluations and land "
"title surveying, which require a higher relative and absolute accuracy."

"In general terms, one can expect the relative accuracy to be in the order of"
" 1 to 3 times the average GSD for the dataset. And as for the absolute "
"accuracy, one must consider that it is dependent of the GPS unit mounted in "
"the UAV but the horizontal accuracy of a standard GPS is usually in the "
"range of 2 to 6 meters and the vertical accuracy between 3 to 4 times the "
"horizontal accuracy."

"The higher the flight altitude, the larger the image footprint and GSD. The "

"Flight speed have special effect in cameras equipped with rolling shutter, "
"while those equipped with global or mechanical shutter tends to reduce this "
"effect. UAV equipped with RTK positioning systems are also affected with the"
" speed, but with hover at each photo taken, you can get very good accuracy. "
"If instead you are moving during each photo take, the accuracy is going to "
"be limited by two factors: the speed at which you are moving multiplied by "
"the 1 second increments of RTK (Mather 2020)."
