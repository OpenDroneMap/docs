"ODM, NodeODM and WebODM are available on all major platforms (Windows, macOS"

"software. Docker offers a way to run “containers”. Containers are packaged "
"copies of an entire system, its software and its dependencies. These "
"containers run within a virtual environment. On Linux this virtual "
"environment is available from the operating system and is very efficient. On"
" macOS and Windows the containers run within a VM, so there’s a bit of a "
"overhead. but it’s still very suitable for running the software. Once "
"installed users do not have to worry much about docker, as it operates "
