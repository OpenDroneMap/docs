"Starting from ODM ``2.0`` people can supply image masks to inform the "
"software to skip reconstruction over certain areas. This is useful for cases"
" where the sky was accidentally included in the input photos from oblique "
"shots, or simply to limit the reconstruction of a single subject."

"To add a mask, simply create a new black and white image of the same "
"dimension as the target image you want to mask (you can use a program such "
"as GIMP to do this). Color in black the areas to exclude from the "
"reconstruction."

"For example, ``DJI_0018.JPG`` can have a mask by creating a "
"``DJI_0018_mask.JPG`` file and include that in the list of images. You can "
"use ``.JPG``, ``.PNG``, ``.BMP`` and ``.TIF`` formats for image masks."
