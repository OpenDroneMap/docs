"OpenDroneMap is FOSS software.  Free and open source (FOSS) projects are "
"interesting from the inside and outside: from the outside, successful ones "
"feel like they should be able to do anything, and it’s hard to know what a "
"reasonable request is. From the inside of a project, they can feel very "
"resource constrained: largely by time, money, and opportunity overload."

"Ang OpenDroneMap ay FOSS na software. Ang nga Free and open sourse (FOSS) na"
" proyekto ay nakakainteres mula sa loob palabas: mula sa labas, ang "
"pakiramdam ng mga matagumpay ay dapat kaya na nilang gawin ang kahit ano, at"
" mahirap alamin kung ano ang risonable na request. Mula naman sa loob ng "
"proyekto, mararamdaman nila na kulang ang kanilang pinagkukunan: higit sa "
"lahat aa oras, pera at oportunitad."
