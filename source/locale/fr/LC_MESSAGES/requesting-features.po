"All software needs user feedback and feature requests, to grow and maintain "
"alignment with the needs of its users."

"OpenDroneMap is FOSS software.  Free and open source (FOSS) projects are "
"interesting from the inside and outside: from the outside, successful ones "
"feel like they should be able to do anything, and it’s hard to know what a "
"reasonable request is. From the inside of a project, they can feel very "
"resource constrained: largely by time, money, and opportunity overload."

"A feature request can be submitted as issues on the applicable Github "
"repository (e.g., `WebODM <https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/WebODM/issues>`_ "
"or `ODM <https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM/issues>`_ or similar) or more "
"simply as a discussion topic on `the community forum "
"<https://community.opendronemap.org/>`_. Try to start by searching these "
"sources to see if someone else has already brought it up.  Sometimes a "
"feature is already in the works, or has at least been discussed."

"And importantly, the trick is to listen: if someone within the project says:"
" \"This is a big lift, we need MONEY or TIME or SOMEONE TO HELP CODE IT\" "
"(or possibly a combination of the three) then there are two answers that "
"work really well in response:"

"*Ok. I didn’t know it was a big feature request! I hope someone comes along "
