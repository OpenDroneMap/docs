:ref:`cameras<cameras>` <json>
  Use the camera parameters computed from another dataset instead of calculating them. Can be specified either as path to a cameras.json file or as a JSON string representing the contents of a cameras.json file. Default: ``

:ref:`cog<cog>`

:ref:`dem-gapfill-steps<dem-gapfill-steps>` <positive integer>
  Number of steps used to fill areas with gaps. Set to 0 to disable gap filling. Starting with a radius equal to the output resolution, N different DEMs are generated with progressively bigger radius using the inverse distance weighted (IDW) algorithm and merged together. Remaining gaps are then merged using nearest neighbor interpolation. Default: ``3``

:ref:`dem-resolution<dem-resolution>` <float>
  DSM/DTM resolution in cm / pixel. Note that this value is capped to 2x the ground sampling distance (GSD) estimate. To remove the cap, check --ignore-gsd also. Default: ``5``

  Set feature extraction quality. Higher quality generates better features, but requires more memory and takes longer. . Default: ``high``

:ref:`feature-type<feature-type>` akaze |  hahog |  orb |  sift
  Choose the algorithm for extracting keypoints and computing descriptors. . Default: ``sift``

:ref:`force-gps<force-gps>` 
  Use images' GPS exif data for reconstruction, even if there are GCPs present.This flag is useful if you have high precision GPS measurements. If there are no GCPs, this flag does nothing. Default: ``False``

:ref:`gcp<gcp>` <path string>
  Path to the file containing the ground control points used for georeferencing. The file needs to use the following format: EPSG:<code> or <+proj definition>geo_x geo_y geo_z im_x im_y image_name [gcp_name] [extra1] [extra2]Default: ``None``

  Generate single file Binary glTF (GLB) textured models. Default:  ``False``

:ref:`gps-accuracy<gps-accuracy>` <positive float>

If your images are tagged with high precision GPS information (RTK), this value will be automatically set accordingly. You can use this option to manually set it in case the reconstruction fails. Lowering this option can sometimes help control bowling-effects over large areas. Default: ``10``

:ref:`help<help>` 
  show this help message and exit

:ref:`ignore-gsd<ignore-gsd>` 
  Ignore Ground Sampling Distance (GSD). GSD caps the maximum resolution of image outputs and resizes images when necessary, resulting in faster processing and lower memory usage. Since GSD is an estimate, sometimes ignoring it can result in slightly better image output quality. Default: ``False``

:ref:`matcher-neighbors<matcher-neighbors>` <positive integer>
  Perform image matching with the nearest images based on GPS exif data. Set to 0 to match by triangulation. Default: ``0``

:ref:`matcher-type<matcher-type>` bow |  bruteforce |  flann

  The maximum vertex count of the output mesh. Default: ``200000``

:ref:`min-num-features<min-num-features>` <integer>
  Minimum number of features to extract per image. More features can be useful for finding more matches between images, potentially allowing the reconstruction of areas with little overlap or insufficient features. More features also slow down processing. Default: ``10000``

:ref:`no-gpu<no-gpu>` 
  Do not use GPU acceleration, even if it's available. Default: ``False``

:ref:`pc-sample<pc-sample>` <positive float>
  Filters the point cloud by keeping only a single point around a radius N (in meters). This can be useful to limit the output resolution of the point cloud and remove duplicate points. Set to 0 to disable sampling. Default: ``0``

:ref:`pc-skip-geometric<pc-skip-geometric>`
