Data Processing

Can I process two or more orthophoto GeoTIFFs to stitch them together? 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

No. ODM is a photogrammetric pipeline and orthophotos do not have the necessary camera information since the images have already been orthorectified. You can use another program such as `Hugin <http://hugin.sourceforge.net/>`_ to do that.

Licensing
*********

I want to build a commercial application that includes ODM. Do I need a commercial license?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ODM is free and open source software, released under the `AGPLv3 <https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM/blob/master/LICENSE>`_. You are free to build and sell applications with it, just make sure to comply with the requirements of the license, in particular the disclose source requirement.

Are there other licensing options aside from the AGPLv3?
--------------------------------------------------------

Sorry, no.
